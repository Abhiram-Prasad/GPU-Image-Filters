# GPU Accelerated Image Filters
Used GPU programming libraries like pyCUDA to increase the speed of processing of commonly used image filters such as Black & White filter, Negative filter, Color filter and Brightness filter.

Achieved ~24x speedup in comparison to the serial versions of the image filters when tested with 1K, 2K and 4K images.
